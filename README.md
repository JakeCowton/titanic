Develop a complete analysis pipeline in a programming language / environment of your choice.
Note that kaggle provides substantial support for this and you could even run the experiments on
the kaggle site. Demonstrators will provide support for Python, R, and Matlab implementations.
However, it is strongly recommended that you attempt the challenge using Python. Relevant
Python resources are listed at the end of this document.

The objective of the analysis is to predict survivors of the Titanic disaster from the given data as
accurately as possible.

2There are no limitations with regards to the modelling approach, that is, you are free to explore
(and report) as many methods, and their results, as you wish. The minimum requirement though is
that you analyze the dataset with a random forest classifier.

You will report the results of your experiments through prediction, that is, classification accuracies
with regard to correctly predicted survival rates.

Note that you are NOT required to submit your solution to the official kaggle competition.
